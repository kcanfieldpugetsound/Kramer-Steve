NOTES AND IDEAS FOR OUR iOS GAME

Let's start brainstorming about the genre of our game. I know we talked about a f.p.s., but if we had other ideas or a more specific genre, then that might be good. 

I was thinking about something like the N.O.V.A. series-- not too gory and the enemies are cyborg aliens, rather than humans or zombies. Does this sound good to you?
